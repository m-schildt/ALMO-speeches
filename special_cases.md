# Special cases to consider when parsing
## Add as needed and identify an example with the thate of the speech in question

- Location missing
- Speech starts with a "narrator" that is not identified (2018.12.11 - Let's agree on this date format: YYYY.MM.DD)
- Speaker is identified as "PREGUNTA". This implies a loss of granularity, as many speakers will have the same label.
